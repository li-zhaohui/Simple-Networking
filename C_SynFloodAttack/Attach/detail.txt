Hello,
For testing purposes for my network and my firewall rules, I need to have a TCP-SYN flood script able to complete Three-way Handshake with the target before the flood.

Of course, the script must use socks5 proxies for the source IPs of the packets sent, because with IP Spoofing it is not possible to complete Three-way Handshake.

The script must have in argv:
target, port, time (in seconds), threads, PPS (packets per seconds and -1 for no limit), proxy list (.txt).

My working environment is linux, debian 9 64 bits.

This script should preferably be coded in C or python.

Thanks.
